# Project Title

Apex Online

# Project Backstory
Apex is an idea that aims at creating a site that gives self
taught professionals in the fields of design and software
engineering(more to come) a chance to get hired by firms without any formal
certification. It is based of the belief that getting a degree,
diploma and the like however important it may be should not
suffice as reason enough to exercise monopoly over said fields.
It's an ambitious project, completely open source and a first
in many respects in the region i'm from.

# Project Overview
It should be noted that the project in its current state, is in no way a market ready product and at its very initial phase release, thus a lot of bugs should be expected. The reason i took the prerogative to especially host it on **Heroku** is to get a real world feel of the project when it does officially go live. It is also meant to elicit as much feedback from fellow developers as possible.

# Prerequisites
For the web application to run locally a few requirements are necessary:
* Python 3 or newer
* Django
* Graphene Django
* Virtualenv(python)
* Pip(the python package installer)
* Postgres database admin ( for managing the database)
* All the listed dependencies in the **requirements.txt** file
* Git
>> NB: All the commands in the README.md on setup and running assume a windows based environment

# Heroku hosting
The api is hosted on [heroku](https://apexselftaughtapi.herokuapp.com/apexselftaught/)
